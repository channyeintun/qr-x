## Understanding which browsers Tailwind supports and how to manage vendor prefixes.


While most of the features in Tailwind CSS will work in all modern browsers, Tailwind also includes APIs for several bleeding-edge features that arenâ€™t yet supported by all browsers, for example the :focus-visible pseudo-class and backdrop-filter utilities.


<Note>
In general, Tailwind CSS v3.0 is designed for and tested on the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. It does not support any version of IE, including IE 11.
